This is my first year microprocessor project. Our game is called Fruit Gambits and its a game where you play as a princess running around and trying to catch as much fruit as you can.There are 2 levels and everytime you miss a fruit you lose a life and if you miss 3 fruit then you lose. 

This game was coded in C and Assembly.

This is the link to a video of Fruit Gambits being played:
