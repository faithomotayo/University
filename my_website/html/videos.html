          "My experience with International Education was life changing for me and everyone involved in the most astonishing way possible. I experienced extensive personal growth from stepping out of my comfort zone by going to a new country with a different first language and teaching there. However I do not regret it and I will never forget my students and the people I met there!

          "International Ed has made a huge change in my life and my families life as we moved to Myanmar together for my year program. It was one of the best experiences of our lives. The locals were welcoming and friendly and they had a tight and welcoming community. International Ed ensured that me and my family were taken care of and that we had all of our needs met. The children in the program were extremely sweet and polite and the experience was overall adventurous and beneficial. I am also now a certified Cultural ambassador for International Education!

      "Teaching abroad has given more opportunities than I could have imagined! It gave me a unique network of overseas connections that I can now reach out to if I want help teaching in another country. It was amazing noticing my students growth by the end of the program and one of my highlights from my program was when my students would help me learn the local language by giving me a pop quiz. I also had the great luck of experiencing the cultural festivals in Nigeria too and it was beautiful. "

  "The kids in our school really loved this program and their teacher who was sent to help them. They said they really enjoyed being able to broaden their understanding of the world and their education. We are so grateful to have recieved help from International Education and we look forward to the next person that they send over for our kids. Thank you so much International Ed and until next time!"

      In International Education we believe in the happiness of our students and the members of staff and that is why we try and have days out in the town and sports days and events for the kids. These pictures above were all captured during the events we held for our students and these are pictures of the locals that we had the consent to take and use! We believe in diversity and cultural immersion and we strive to use our program to push this!
