This is my web development project from first year. My website was about setting up a charity to provide children in less fortunate countries 
with education.Teachers could signup to go abroad to schools in countries that we were set up in to
give the kids great education.

I created this website using JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. To enhance it, I plan to develop it into a full-stack application by integrating MySQL and PHP for dynamic data storage and processing. Additionally, I aim to implement more UI/UX improvements, such as adding a dark mode feature and ensuring the website layout is responsive across different screen sizes.
