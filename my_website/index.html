                        is why
                        partnered up with <strong>Action Aid</strong> to provide an education for students in
                        underdeveloped countries by
                        doing a <strong>teacher exchange and sending educators</strong> over there to teach in schools
                        that we built.

                        We believe that it is important to elevate and develop the strong and great minds of tomorrow and
